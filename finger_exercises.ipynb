You can also remove connections by clicking on them.

    "In this problem, we're going to calculate some probabilities of dice rolls. Imagine you have two fair four-sided dice (if you've never seen one, [here's a picture](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/fb089d94485d7a3adc6951358b07f90f/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.2x+3T2021+type@asset+block/files_finger_exercises_d4-translucent-red.jpg). The result, a number between 1 and 4, is displayed at the top of the die on each of the 3 visible sides). 'Fair' here means that there is equal probability of rolling any of the four numbers.\n",

    "You can answer the following questions in one of two ways - you can calculate the probability directly, or, if you're having trouble, you can simply write out the entire [sample space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space) for the problem. A sample space is defined as a listing of all possible outcomes of a problem, and it can be written in many ways - a tree or a grid are popular options. For example, here is a diagram of the [sample space for 3 coin tosses](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/b6e4ea1e4183e95cfbce003ee9675ab1/asset-v1:MITx+6.00.2x+3T2021+type@asset+block/files_finger_exercises_coinTossSampleSpace.png).\n",

    "As an example, let's say we flip a coin. Define the event *H* as the event that the coin comes up heads. We can assign the probability *P(H)* = 1/2; the likelihood that event *H* occurs.\n",
